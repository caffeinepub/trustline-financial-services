# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Job Requirements section to the Trustline Financial Services homepage for a Credit Card Sales role, and link to it from site navigation.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new homepage section with an H2 heading (e.g., “Job Requirements” / “Credit Card Sales — Job Requirements”), professional English copy covering the specified role requirements, and an anchor id (e.g., `id="job-requirements"`).
- Update the top navbar to include a “Job Requirements” (or “Careers”) anchor link that smoothly scrolls to the new section on the Home page and matches existing cross-page navigation behavior.
- Update the footer “Quick Links” to include a matching link to `#job-requirements`.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can find and read the Credit Card Sales job requirements on the homepage and jump to the section via navbar/footer links.
