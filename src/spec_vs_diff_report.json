  "summary": "Implemented a new JobRequirementsSection on the homepage with an anchored <section id=\"job-requirements\"> and professional copy, and updated Navbar and Footer to include smooth-scroll navigation to that section (including from the Admin page by navigating back to Home first). One acceptance-criteria detail appears not met: the footer quick link does not actually navigate to the #job-requirements hash; it performs scrollIntoView via a button.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Footer “Quick Links” includes a matching link that navigates to #job-requirements.",
      "reason": "Footer uses a <button> with scrollIntoView('job-requirements') rather than a link (e.g., <a href=\"#job-requirements\">) that navigates to the URL hash #job-requirements as stated in the AC.",
